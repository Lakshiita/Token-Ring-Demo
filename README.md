# Token-Ring-Demo
This code shows how token Ring protocol works
Write a program to implement Token Ring. Randomly generates 10 numbers and treats these
as stations. Select any one station as a source and another as a destination. Source will
transmit frames including source and destination address. All other stations except destination will
forward the packet and destination station will copy the data and display. Finally, source station
will delete the frame.

**Demo Output :**

Ten stations in the network:(Calculation)

Source:(User I/p)

Destination:(User I/p)

Data to Send:(User I/p)

Path of traversal:(Calculation)

Data at destination:(Calculation)

Path of traversal:(Calculation)

**Output of traversal :**

A A|D|Hello

B A|D|Hello

C A|D|Hello

D This is destination : Hello

E A|D|Hello

A Null
